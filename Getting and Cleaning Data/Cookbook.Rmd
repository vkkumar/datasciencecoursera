# Getting and Cleaning Data
## Codebook for gathering and tidying data

### Analysis method
 - `dplyr` library is used for data analysis in this assignment
 - Both training and test data sets are respectively collated as data frames
 - They are given accurante column names as read from the the features document
 - Using rbind both train and test data frames are combined
 - The column names are coverted to R friendly names, without sacrificing the information
 - The filtered data with column names that contains the strings "mean" and "std" is created
 - A tidy data is created using a select query
 - Appropriate labels are assigned to the activity_labels by merging with the information provided in `activity_labels.txt`
 - The final filtered data is written to the `run_data_summary.txt` file
